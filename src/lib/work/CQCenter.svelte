          An e-learning platform for cultural intelligence training. I was the
          acting lead software engineer of the application, and I was
          responsible for the development of the platform's front-end and
          back-end. I also educated the other developers on the application
          structure, and how to use the technologies we were using.

          The project I'm most proud of during my time developing this
          application is the development of a scalable PDF report generation
          solution. Using AWS Lambda to handle the rendering and storage of
          generated reports allowed for us to reduce worker and web load, and
          decrease costs due to AWS's pay-per-use model, which ended up being
          nearly free with current usage.
