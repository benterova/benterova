# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who enjoys building things that live on the internet. I aim to develop apps and websites that people use daily and enjoy using them.

I work primarily with the following tech:
- Ruby (and Rails)
- Typescript (and React)
- Rust (just Rust. Rust is fun.)
- Svelte (this repo is built with Svelte!)
